# This is the official documentation for FelloHub

The onboarding page on its own shows the different types of onboarding available:

- Fellowship
- Individual

Note: When one is on a particular fellowship, say dlcfoau.fellohub.com, this page would automatically redirect to the onboarding/individual page

## Join A Fellowship Page

- This shows a list of fellowships currently available on our app.

- Users gets redirected here if they try to access the onboarding/individual route from the brand page and not the fellowship page.

- For example, trying to access the onboarding/individual page from fellowhub.com, but if coming from dlcfoau.fellowhub.com, u get redirected to the page successfully.
